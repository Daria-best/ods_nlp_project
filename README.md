The goal of this project was to develop a search engine for machine
learning papers relevant to user queries. As a part of this effort, I compiled
a dataset from NeurIPS papers, annotated it with synthetic labels using
quantization of a small LLM, used it for fine-tuning a distilled embedding
model, and developed a command line interface for retrieval of relevant
documents from embedded corpus.
